# ImageTextView

The `ImageTextView` module allows you to use the `ImageTextView` class. This is a subclass of `UITextView` which allows you to easily insert images into your view. Additionally, it provides a placeholder for your `UITextView`.

The easiest way to include `TouchDraw` is by using `CocoaPods`.

```
use_frameworks!
pod 'ImageTextView', '~> 1.0'
```

To use `TouchDrawView` you must first write `import ImageText` in whichever classes will use `TouchDrawView`.

You can look at the `Demo` folder to see an example project.

**Please note that this module is in early stages of development. Ye been warned! **
